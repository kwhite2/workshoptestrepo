# Rutgers-Newark Intro to GitHub for Academic Writing: Glossary
Definitions taken directly from the [GitHub Glossary](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary)

## [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#branch)

A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.

## [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#clone)

A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.

Krista's note: ***Clone*** copies the whole repository to your machine or GitHub - whichever you tell it to. Clones saved in different locations do not sync automatically. To sync your GitHub version with the version saved on your computer, you have to ***commit*** changes and then ***push*** the latest version to the location you were NOT working in.

## [commit](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#commit)

A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.

## [push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#push)

To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.

## [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#repository)

A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
