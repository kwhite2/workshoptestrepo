Create a repository called GitHub_Practice.
Rename README.md to Syllabus.md. If you have a book chapter or other written item for this exercise, name the file after that. Be sure to put the .md file type marker at the end of the file name.
Copy/paste your syllabus/other document into the Syllabus.md file.
Commit your changes.
Create a new document called ClassNotes.md. 
Write something in the page. Do a little markdown formatting. Put in a heading, a sub-heading, a bulleted list, a hyperlink and some normal text.
Commit your changes.
Create a new branch for the repository. Name it GitHub_Practice_branch1.
Add a new, non-markdown file to the branch. 
<!--- I purposefully did not remind students to commit changes in the last instruction. I wanted them to learn to do it automatically.
-->
Hyperlink in the GitHub_Practice_branch1/README.md to the new file you just uploaded.
