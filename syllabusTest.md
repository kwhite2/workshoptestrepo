Course Description: 

In Comics and Graphic Novels Lab we will implement knowledge gained in course lectures by creating our own digital comics. We will integrate information about the critical framework and vocabulary for defining and describing comics and put that information into practice while learning to use digital tools. One of the most important goals of the course is for students to increase their digital literacy skills. Digital literacy is defined by the New York City Department of Education as, “the knowledge and ability to use a range of technology tools for varied purposes … use technology strategically to find and evaluate information, collaborate with others and produce and share original content.”  Included in the course’s skills set will be the ability to self-teach new digital tools and techniques. The lab will include instruction on basic drawing, drawing for comics and storyboarding techniques. We will also discuss creators’ rights and intellectual property issues. Students will learn to draw with iPads, as well as use Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign. Students will also learn the basics of putting together a digital exhibit and learn to layout and format an ebook using OMEKA digital exhibit software and Calibre for laying out and organizing ebooks. Woven throughout the course will be instruction on troubleshooting computer problems and persistence in the face of roadblocks using technology. The final project for the lab will be a digital exhibit featuring each student’s best digital comic and an ebook with examples of each student’s work contained therein. 

Required Texts and materials (Available at New Jersey Books, at the Campus Bookstore and on Reserve in the Library):

Required Course Reading:
1. Lee, Stan and Buscema, John. How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way  (Touchstone, ISBN 978-0671530778)  
2. McCloud, Scott. Making Comics (William Morrow Paperbacks, ISBN 978-0060780944) 

Required Course Materials:
Active Scarletmail and ScarletDocs Accounts
Active AppleID account
250GB (or larger) Hard drive for storing course assignments
Artist-grade Drawing Pad 
3 Drawing Pencils – one of each of the following hardnesses: 2B, HB, 2H

Course Requirements:

1. Attendance & Participation: Attendance is not mandatory, but, in the end, you will only hurt your grade by failing to show up. Lab time is a 3-hour block each week that is crucial for learning the skills to complete projects and get any help you may need with tasks. It’s not possible to replace lab time, so be prepared to show up every week. We will also discuss techniques and tips each week, so participation is an important part of lab time.

2. Weekly Assignments: Each week there will be a lab assignment. Lab assignments will combine a new lab skill with concepts from that week’s lecture. These assignments will count for a large portion of your lab grade. Late assignments will be accepted on a limited basis. After two weeks, if you do not turn in an assignment, you will get a 0 on that assignment. Late assignments will be graded at my convenience.

3. Presentations/Demonstrations: Each student will do one “Peanut Butter and Jelly” (PB&J) assignment during the semester.  PB&J assignments are a step-by-step presentation of how you performed some task or new skill for the previous week’s assignment. If you do your PB&J assignment early in the semester, you should demonstrate the hands-on skills from labs; When the course moves into digital tools, PB&J assignment should demonstrate your digital literacy skills. This may be a tech skill you figured out on your own that goes beyond the basics we cover in class, or it may be a demonstration of how you troubleshot a problem with software you experienced when doing the assignment. The point of the PB&J assignment is to get you to think systematically about how you do things, and break it down into discrete tasks. This is an essential skill when troubleshooting problems with technology.

4. Final Project: The final project – a comic you’ve created – should demonstrate your mastery of lab skills, digital literacy and lecture material. The final project will take 2 forms: An online digital exhibit created using OMEKA software, and an ebook compendium of your peer-reviewed comics. We will decide during the course of the semester how we want to handle the intellectual property issues. 

Responsibilities

1. Original work. Plagiarism is unacceptable in writing. Stealing another artists’ work without their permission is unethical AND violates U.S. copyright laws. Any work you turn in to me should be created by you. If it is a group assignment, all contributors to the work should be listed. Plagiarism and copyright infringement are serious offenses. Plagiarism may be punishable with failing grades or expulsion. Since we will be discussing intellectual property in this course, Rutgers Newark considers plagiarism a very serious offence. Disciplinary action may include a failing grade or expulsion. For an overview of the university's policies visit: academicintegrity.rutgers.edu  
2. Assignment format. All written work should be proofread, typed in 12-point font, double-spaced, and paginated. Your name, my name, the course name, and the date should appear on the first page (no cover page is necessary). All papers and exams should include the Rutgers University Honor Pledge: “On my honor, I have neither received nor given any unauthorized assistance on this assignment.” 

Resources

1. Writing. Students seeking additional help with their writing are encouraged to consult the tutors at The Writing Center (www.ncas.rutgers.edu/writingcenter). The Writing Program offers tutoring and other services for multilingual learners, (www.ncas.rutgers.edu/writingprogram).

2. Accommodations. In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, a student with a disability must contact the campus Office of Disability Services, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation.
