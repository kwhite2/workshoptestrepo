# Notes on Text Analysis using NLTK
 ## Why would you use different text analysis functions?
### Concordance 
- To see how a word is used
- To see how often a word is used
- To see the contexts in which a word is used

The *number of returns* for the concordance tells you *how many times* the a term is used in a text. A concordance *provides context* for a term by listing the term with a specified number of words on either side.

### Similar (aka "Word Similarity")
- To see what other words appear in similar contexts
- Provides a slightly different lense on context than "concordance."

Provides a list of words that appear in similar contexts to a term throughout the text. Using "similar" for the same term in two texts provides contrast (or comparison) of the how the words are used differently (or similarly) in those texts.
