### How to Merge 
- Start from the branch that has the changes you want to incorporate.
- Do a [Pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) These are usually set to compare the contents of the current branch with the contents of the main branch (called the base branch). You can [change the base branch to another branch in a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request).
- [Review the changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request) to make sure they are what you want to incorporate/merge. GitHub will force you to do this automatically if there are Merge conflicts. You'll know you have Merge conflicts when you create the Pull request and it tells you that the two branches cannot be automatically merged.
- If necessary, resolve [Merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github).
- NOW you can [Merge your Pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request#merging-a-pull-request).
