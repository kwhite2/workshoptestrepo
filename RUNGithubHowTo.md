### How to Merge 
- First you have to do a [Pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) These are usually set to compare the contents of the current branch with the contents of the main branch (called the base branch). You can [change the base branch to another branch in a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request).
- If necessary, resolve [Merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github)
